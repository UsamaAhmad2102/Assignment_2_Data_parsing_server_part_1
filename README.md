# Assignment_2_Data_parsing_server_part_1
Data parsing server - Part I


This is a continuation of the assignment: Data Parsing.

Create a single server. Using one of the langauges from the data parsing assignment would make sense. Remember, at this level it is your job to make decision such as language, libraries and frameworks.

Create endpoints for each data parsing task that serves the data.

There should be an endpoint for each: XML, CSV YAML, TXT and JSON.

Hand-in: Submit links to the relevant folder in your Github repository.
